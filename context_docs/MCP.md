# Model Context Protocols (MCPs)

Model Context Protocols (MCPs) are a crucial component of the MCPAgents framework, defining the structure and management of context within agent interactions. They act as blueprints for how agents perceive, interpret, and contribute to the shared understanding of their environment and ongoing tasks.

An MCP essentially outlines the key elements of context relevant to a specific interaction or task. This might include:

*   **Shared Knowledge:** Information accessible to all participating agents, such as task goals, environmental states, or common knowledge bases.
*   **Individual Beliefs:** Each agent's private understanding, including their current state, plans, and beliefs about other agents.
*   **Communication History:** A record of past interactions, including messages exchanged and actions performed.
*   **Task-Specific Data:** Any data relevant to the specific task, such as sensor readings, user input, or intermediate results.

MCPs provide a standardized way to represent and update this contextual information, ensuring consistency and coherence across agents. They enable agents to:

*   **Maintain a Shared Understanding:** By adhering to a common MCP, agents can effectively synchronize their knowledge and beliefs, leading to more coordinated and efficient collaboration.
*   **Reason about Context:** MCPs provide a structured representation of context, allowing agents to reason about the current situation, anticipate the actions of others, and make informed decisions.
*   **Adapt to Changing Circumstances:** MCPs can be dynamically updated to reflect changes in the environment, task requirements, or agent states, enabling agents to adapt their behavior accordingly.

In essence, MCPs are the foundation for effective communication and collaboration among agents, ensuring that they operate within a shared and well-defined understanding of their context.
